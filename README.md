# MemeBot

Source files for the article on [Marcofolio.net](http://www.marcofolio.net/) called "[*Generating Meme images through a Bot*](https://marcofolio.net/generate-meme-images-bot/)" . This sample uses [the Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) to build a chatbot and consumes [the APIMeme](http://apimeme.com/) (through [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/user/ronreiter/package/Meme%20Generator)) to generate the images.

Read [the article](https://marcofolio.net/generate-meme-images-bot/) to get more information about how this works.
